- I am currently a CS Master Student at [JHU](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) advised by [Prof. Raman Arora](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/).
- Prior to join JHU, I received my M.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from [UF](https://www.ufl.edu/) and B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Tongji](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/).
- My research interests include **Reinforcement Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**, especially the intersection of these two fields.
